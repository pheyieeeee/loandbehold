    <p>With a great passion for designing, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/afcalma/">Ar. Angellee Faith Calma</a> took up Bachelor of Science in Architecture at Holy Angel University and earned her bachelor’s degree thereafter. She had her
      apprenticeship on architectural firms that specializes
      in high-end design and build services that made her grow in the profession and experience in the actual process of designing and translating it to an actual building or structure with regards to various laws and design principles. She believes
      that Architecture is a continuous learning experience. Right after gaining her license as an architect, she pursued another career to add up to her expertise and became a Licensed Master Plumber. She uses different software and creates 3d
      models to create good overviews of a building to fully present her vision to her clients.</p>
